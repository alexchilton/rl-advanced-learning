"""Prepend a cell that makes `../input/<slug>/...` resolve on any Kaggle layout.

Kaggle mounts attached data in two different shapes, and nothing I could
isolate in kernel-metadata.json controls which you get -- same pinned image,
same source lists, different result:

    ../input/<slug>/...                       what every course notebook assumes
    /kaggle/input/datasets/<owner>/<slug>/    seen on API-pushed kernels
    /kaggle/input/competitions/<slug>/        likewise, for competition data

Rewriting the paths inside the notebook is not enough, and finding that out
cost a wasted push: the exercises fail at `from learntools.<course>.exN import
*`, because learntools loads the data itself, at import time, through its own
hardcoded `../input/...`. Nothing in the notebook can reach those strings.

So the fix is to make the path real rather than to avoid it. `/kaggle/input` is
read-only, but the working directory is not, so the prelude builds a directory
of symlinks under /kaggle/working and changes into a sibling of it. After that
`../input/<slug>` resolves for every reader -- the notebook, learntools, and
the course's own `os.symlink` of a competition file to a bare `../input/x.csv`,
which then works because this `../input` is writable.

The cost is that the working directory moves, so files the notebook writes land
in /kaggle/working/_nb/ instead of /kaggle/working/. They are still collected.
