"""Report every graded question that is still unanswered.

Three notebooks shipped with an unanswered question because the stub detector
was built from one example. This course family marks a blank at least four
ways -- `____`, an empty `""" """` query, a complete query under "# Amend the
query below", and a bare assignment like `trend = food_sales` -- and the last
two run without error, so nothing fails until a human reads the grader.

It reports two things. First, any cell anywhere that still contains `____` --
in several courses the answer cell is separate from the cell that calls
`check()`, so looking only at check cells misses them entirely. Second, and not
relying on any pattern, it compares each built notebook against the untouched
copy in `sources/` and lists every `q_N.check()` cell that is byte-identical,
i.e. every question left exactly as the exercise shipped it.
That is only correct when the question needs no answer, which is what the
`--thought-experiments` argument records: those question numbers are
`ThoughtExperiment` in the learntools grader and are credited by running the
cell.

    python kaggle/_tools/audit.py <course> [--thought-experiments ex2:1,3 ex4:2]

Exits non-zero if anything is unanswered, so it can gate a push.
